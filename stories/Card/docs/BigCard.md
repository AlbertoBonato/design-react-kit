Cards with large shading are characterized by classes:

`.card-bg`: used in the div (`card`) to create background and shadow of the card.

`.card-big`: used in the div (`card`) is used for the sizing of its contents.

In the following example a large icon has been inserted before the card title, the div containing the icon is class `.top-icon`.
